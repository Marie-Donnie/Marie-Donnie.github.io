<p>I'm a research engineer working
at <a href="https://www.inria.fr/">Inria</a> Rennes--Bretagne
Atlantique, France. I received a Master in software architecture from
the University of Nantes in France, in 2018.</p>

<p>I worked on massively distributed cloud computing infrastructures for
edge computing since my first internship in 2016. </p>

<p>I also have a Licence in biology which I obtained at University of Le
Havre in France, 2008.</p>

<p>I am interested in many different topics which includes obviously
computer science, but also nature (earth and beyond), biology, cinema and gaming. I
also enjoy cooking (mostly occidental and japanese food) and more
largely making stuff with my hands.</p>

      Kakapos are flightless parrots endemic to (leaving only in) New Zealand. Being flightless and hunted by humans (and human introduced predators), the kakapos were in the verge of extinction. The Kākāpō Recovery program began in 1989, moving leaving kakapos to remote islands. So the population grew from 51 to around 150 at the beginning of 2019 and after a successful breeding season, more than 200 kakapos live now in New Zealand. If you want to know more, donate, or even *adopt* a kakapo (awarding you a cute plushy, a bookmark, a sticker and a certificate of adoption), you can go on <a href="https://www.doc.govt.nz/our-work/kakapo-recovery/">Kākāpō Recovery website</a>.

	  <div class="abstract">
	    Resource management systems are key elements of distributed infrastructures. At HotEdge'18, we alerted our community of the importance of delivering such a system to favor the advent of the edge computing paradigm. While new initiatives have been proposed, they are far from offering the expected features to administrate and use geo-distributed infrastructures such as the edge ones. However, there is an opportunity to move forward by proposing a break through approach in the design of resource management systems for the edge. We give the premises of such an approach by illustrating how multiple instances of a Virtual Infrastructure Manager can collaborate with each other while mitigating code efforts. Our proposal leverages service concepts, dynamic composition as well as programming software abstractions. Beyond the development of a resource management system for edge infrastructures, our proposal may lead to a new way of distributing applications where intermittent network is the norm.

      Juice is a tool built to test the performances of MariaDB, MariaDB Galera Cluster and CockroachDB using <a href="https://github.com/akopytov/sysbench">Sysbench</a> or <a href="https://github.com/openstack/rally">OpenStack Rally</a>. It can be used to test any other databases wanted by adding it into the database role. It also monitors system and database metrics via <a href="https://collectd.org/">collectd</a> and <a href="https://github.com/google/cadvisor">cAdvisor</a>.

      Website for my roleplay guild. It was made primarly to know how a website works, with Django as a framework. It enables users to make character sheets, browse through quests, objects (created by the Game Master), search quests on the map, see what happened during campaigns and find the spell for their classes. Still ongoing.

      A small game in C++ made for a course about design pattern (2015). You play a survivor in a medieval setting where zombies have invaded the world during the actual apocalypse. The maps can be customized with a text file that is read by the game.
